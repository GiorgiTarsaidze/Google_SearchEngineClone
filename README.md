# Google Search Engine

This project consists of HTML files and a CSS file that create a simple search interface resembling Google's homepage. The project allows users to perform basic searches, advanced searches, and image searches.

## Usage

To use the project, simply open any of the HTML files (`index.html`, `search_advanced.html`, or `search_image.html`) in a web browser. You can interact with the search input fields, buttons, and links to perform various searches or navigate between different search options.

## Styling

The project's visual styles are defined in the `styles/style.css` file. The CSS file includes styling rules for elements such as the search input fields, buttons, logos, and links. You can modify the CSS file to customize the appearance of the search interface according to your preferences.

Please note that the project's styling currently uses the Google logo provided in the `assets/google_logo.png` file.

## Credits

This project is a basic implementation inspired by Google's search interface. It was created for educational purposes and to demonstrate HTML and CSS skills.
